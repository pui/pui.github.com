Work has been pretty life consuming and has kept me from updating the blog recently.  But since it's the Memorial day weekend and I have some motivation to put things on the Internet, I'm going to post random pictures I've taken with [hipstamatic](http://hipstamaticapp.com/).  I bought hipstamatic this week after seeing my more saavy coworkers [use](http://yfrog.com/509avzj) it.

I took this is in Montgomery station.  It was raining a lot this week, which helped further justify buying rainboots.

I've been able to spend more time with [Sophy](http://knitsnotesetc.com/) lately.  We haven't been doing a lot of knitting together though.  

Hopefully I'll get around to making the blog look different tomorrow.  I think it's time for a different layout.
