This is what Jeremy gave me for Christmas:

  <b>The best puppet ever</b> 
</div>

I found it through [mr x stitch](http://www.mrxstitch.com/2009/06/08/beefrancks-emporium-made-by-moxie) and then it showed up a couple days before Christmas.  I was impatient and opened it right away.  

I have the week between Christmas and New Year's day off.  I have a list of things I want to do, but so far I've only been knitting.  The [February Lady Sweater](http://www.flintknits.com/blog/?p=151) is close to completion.  I have one more sleeve to go.  It's been mostly painless knitting this.  I left out the eyelet increases in the yoke which kept it from being too big.  I can do gull lace in my sleep now.

  <b>It's turning out okay</b>

Jeremy also gave me a camera, so now the blog will have more pictures!
