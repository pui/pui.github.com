title: RubyConf day 1
---

I enjoyed some talks more than others, but [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home), [Ruby Arduino dev](http://github.com/atduskgreg/rad) and [experimental driven development](http://vanity.labnotes.org/) talks were all pretty good.  I'm interested in playing with MongoDB now, just to see what it's like to use a database that does not use SQL as a query language.  I also liked the short talks given by some Japanese Rubyists.  They seemed very enthusiastic about the language (and Japanese food).

Anyway, hearing other people talk about their projects makes me more excited about working on my own projects which is a good thing.  I did some knitting on my [February Lady sweater](http://www.flintknits.com/blog/?p=151) during a morning talk and will hopefully make some more headway tomorrow.  I enjoy the learning and knitting together.
