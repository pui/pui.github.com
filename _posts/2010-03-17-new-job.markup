title: I'm Officially Employed
---

It took a while, but the visa issues have been taken care of and I'm happy to say that I'm working at [Square](https://wwww.squareup.com).  It's been crazy busy and pretty exciting.  I've enjoyed being able to work with a bunch of really smart people and [Chris](http://shiftcommathree.com/) again (who is really smart as well).

I've been working on a real blog post as well, so that will show up soon.  I'm off to bed after a long day.
