title: The blog is up!

After much waffling on how I'd get a new blog on the Internet, I finally went with [github pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages).  It was nice learning about [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and was pretty easy to get things looking the way I wanted.  I'm still not quite done, but after working on this all day, I figure I'd write an actual post.  

I've never really blogged about what I do everyday, so I've decided that that is what I'll do here.  I'm excited about being able to talk about knitting projects in detail and interesting programming-related topics.  I hope to write about what it's been like being a female developer as well, since there are so few of us out there.  

That's it!  More to come soon.  Just to share, dumb bunny comes from my grandfather.  He would call me a dumb bunny whenever I did something silly (or stupid) as a child.  I've always liked it, so here it is :)
